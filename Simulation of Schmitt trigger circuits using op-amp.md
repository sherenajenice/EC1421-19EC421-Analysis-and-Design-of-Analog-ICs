## SIMULATION OF SCHMITT TRIGGER

## AIM:
To Design and simulate the Schmitt trigger circuit using LT Spice

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
LT-Spice

## PROCEDURE:
1. Double click on LT Spice icon.

2. New schematic window open.

3. Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram .

4. Complete the connection.

5. Save the file by giving file name.

6. Click on the run option -->click advanced open -->select Ac analysis-->enter the amplitude time delay stop time value.

7. Click on the run option -->simulation window opens-->place the probe -->output graph is obtained.
